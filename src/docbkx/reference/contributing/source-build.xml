  <title>Source Control and Building</title>
  <para>If you want to contribute to the development of jetty, you will need to work with a handful of technologies.</para>

    <title>Source Control</title>
    <para>Jetty uses several development trunks for its artifacts. They are mirrored on github through http://github.com/eclipse, or you can look through them via the Eclipse setup at the URLs below.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Primary Interest SCM URLs</title>
      <para>These are the URLs to the GIT repositories for the Jetty code. They are for people who are working on the Jetty project, as well as for people who are interested in examining or modifying the Jetty code for their own projects.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.project.git - Jetty Project Repository</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Build and Project Infrastructure SCM URLs</title>
      <para>These are the URLs for Jetty-related code and metadata. These are not needed to use Jetty; these are primarily of use for people who are working with Jetty-the-project (as opposed to using Jetty-the-server in their own projects).</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.parent.git - Administrative pom.xml file</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.toolchain.git - Build related artifacts that release separately, common assembly descriptors, remote resources, etc.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.bundles.git - Project definition for generating an eclipse p2 update site
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.admin.git - Files associated with the development of Jetty -- code styles, formatting, etc.

  <section>
    <title>Build</title>
    <para>Jetty requires the use of Java 7 and the latest releases are always recommended to build.</para>
    <para>Jetty uses <link linkend="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven 3</link> for managing its build and primary project metadata.</para>
    <para>Building Jetty should simply be a matter of changing into the relevant directory and executing the following commands:</para>
    <screen>
<![CDATA[
$ git clone http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.project.git
$ cd org.eclipse.jetty.project
$ mvn install
]]>
    </screen>
    <para>All relevant dependencies will be downloaded into your local repository automatically.</para>
    <note>Jetty has a great many test cases that run through the course of its build.  Periodically we find some test cases to be more timing dependent then they should be and this results in intermittient test failures.  You can help track these down by openning a bug report.</note>
