    <para>The version as indicated above containing SNAPSHOT are updated frequently by an automated process while
    versions that contain M#, RC#, or v#### are durable releases for a specific version of Jetty.</para>

<!-- 
          BASIC: there is a directory called basic, this comprises the basic 
                entry level information for jetty, suitable for someone that is perhaps new 
                to java, new to webapps, new to servlets, etc. Care should be taken in the 
                writing of the basic documents to not assume too much knowledge. In fact 
                the basic directory should strictly be concerned with the distribution and 
                should not stray out too far into other topics. 
                
                Advanced: the advanced directory 
                should contain targeted sections dealing to specific aspects of jetty, for 
                example embedding jetty, using jetty with maven, using jetty in unit tests, 
                information about the architecture of jetty, leveraging the jetty-client, 
                osgi frameworks, etc.

    <title>Quick Start Guide</title>
<!-- 
                First we want a general introduction to what jetty is, perhaps a bit 
                        of history but fairly short and sweet explanation of the what and why for 
                        jetty. -->
    <xi:include href="quick-start/introduction/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Getting started gives the reader enough to download and run the most 
                        simple example of jetty, the distribution which is a very common use case 
                        for someone new to jetty. If know they don't need the distribution then they 
                        are knowledgable enough to consult the TOC for what they want so we keep 
                        this simple and clear for people that don't know what they are doing yet. -->
    <xi:include href="quick-start/getting-started/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Next we have a section completely devoted to configuring the distribution, 
                        targeted areas that are focused on the specific tangible scenarios that people 
                        working with the distribution will run across, if discussion goes to advanced 
                        topics just describe and link deeper into document. NOTE: some topics might 
                        be worth of breaking into a separate basic chapter, like sessions? -->

                Once someone has configured their container they will want to deploy 
                        their application so this chapter discusses how to deploy war files onto 
                        the container or how to link static resources, the context handling system, 
                        etc.
