  <title>What is Jetty?</title>
  <para>Jetty is an open-source project providing an HTTP server, HTTP client, and javax.servlet container. This
  document is broken into two parts. The first part has an emphasis on beginning to use jetty from the context on the
  distribution. It will provides information about downloading Jetty, basic configuration on how to change things like
  the port jetty runs on and adjusting logging levels and configuring many of the most common servlet container
  features like JNDI, JMX and session management. The second part of this document describes advanced usages of jetty,
  specific indepth features like our highly scalable async client, proxy servlet configuration, or configuring the
  jetty maven plugin or using jetty as an embedded server. The advanced section will include tutorials, howtos, videos,
  and some reference materials.</para>
