  <title>Amazon Elastic Beanstalk</title>
  <para>
    <link xl:href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</link> is a component with the <link xl:href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</link> offering that allows you to configure an entire virtual machine based on one of several available baseline configurations and then customize it through a powerful configuration system.  While the default offerings currently available are based on Tomcat for for the java community, we worked out the basics using that configuration system to enable the usage of Jetty instead.

    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      Elastic beanstalk has a very <link xl:href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/10/02/introducing-aws-elastic-beanstalk-configuration-files/">powerful configuration mechanism</link>elast so this integration taps into that to effectively rework the tomcat configuration and replace it with the bits required to make jetty run in its place. Below is a walk through of what the various configuration files are doing and how the general flow of configuration on beanstalk happens.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is an .ebextensions directory in your beanstalk application which contains all of the files requires to configure and customize your beanstalk and application combo. Files that end in .config in this directory are processed in alphabetical order.

            handles replaceing tomcat with jetty in many configuration files, configures logging and wires up system startup processes. Some files in your <filename>.ebextensions</filename> direction are moved to replace files under /opt/elasticbeanstalk.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
      If you look in the .ebextensions of your application you should also see other jetty specific xml and ini files. The final config file handles these as they are largely customization for your application.

    <para>
      The files in our example test webapp here enable various OPTIONS for libraries that need loaded, customize the root application being deployed and even deploy additional contexts like we do in our jetty distribution demo. This is also the mechanism that you would use to wire up application specific things, for example if you needed additional software installed, customized directories made, etc.

              An example webapp that shows both how to combine war file from another maven module with the jetty-beanstalk-overlay to produce a beanstalk enabled application bundle. Also included in this is examples of how to alter jetty configuration for things like a customized <filename>start.ini</filename> file and the like.

      <note>
        <para>
          The test webapps needs access to a snapshot version of the test-jetty-webapp so it really serves as more of an example of how to layer your webapp with the bits required to customize your app for beanstalk and jetty.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        To actually make use of these artifacts you currently must clone this git repository and build it locally. Once you have the artifacts you simply need to copy the approach in the jetty-beanstalk-testapp to apply the configuration to your webapp.

      <title>A Note on Bluepill</title>
      <para>
        Bluepill is used to manage the start and stop process of the app server. This seems to be a problematic bit of software with a colored history and the version in use at the time of this writing is old. When starting and stopping (or restarting) the appserver you may see error messages show up that the Server timed out getting a response or things like that. These are red herrings and my experience is that jetty has started and stopped just fine, the pid file required shows up in a very timely fashion (under <filename>/var/run/jetty.pid</filename>) so do check that the app server has started, but please be aware there is a strangeness here that hasn't been sorted out yet.
