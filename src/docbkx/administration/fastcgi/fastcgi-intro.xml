        <title>FastCGI Introduction</title>
    </info>
    <para>
        FastCGI is a network protocol primarily used by a <emphasis>web server</emphasis> to communicate to a
        <emphasis>FastCGI server</emphasis>.
        FastCGI servers are typically used to serve web content generated by dynamic web languages, primarily
        <link xl:href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</link>, but also Python, Ruby, Perl and others.
    </para>
    <para>
        Web servers that supports FastCGI are, among others, <link xl:href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</link>
        and <link xl:href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</link>, and Jetty.
        Web servers typically act as proxies, converting HTTP requests that they receive from clients (browsers) to
        FastCGI requests that are forwarded to the FastCGI server.
        The FastCGI server spawns the dynamic web language interpreter, passing it the information contained
        in the FastCGI request and a dynamic web language script is executed, producing web content, typically HTML.
        The web content is then formatted into a FastCGI response that is returned to the web server, which
        converts it to a HTTP response that is then returned to the client.
    </para>
    <para>
        The most well known FastCGI server is the <link xl:href="http://php-fpm.org/">PHP FastCGI Process Manager</link>,
        or <code>php-fpm</code>. In the following we will assume that <code>php-fpm</code> is used as FastCGI server.
    </para>
    <para>
        Jetty can be configured to act as a web server that supports FastCGI, replacing the functionality that
        is normally provided by Apache or Nginx.
        This allows users to leverage Jetty features such as SPDY, the unique support that Jetty provides for
        SPDY Push, Jetty's scalability, and of course Jetty's native support for Java Web Standards such as
        Servlets, JSPs, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
        With such configuration, users can deploy their Java Web Applications in Jetty, but also serve their
        <link xl:href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress</link> site or blog or their
        <link xl:href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</link> site without having to install and manage multiple
        web servers.
