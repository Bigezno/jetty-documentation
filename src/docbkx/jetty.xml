<!-- 
          BASIC: there is a directory called basic, this comprises the basic 
                entry level information for jetty, suitable for someone that is perhaps new 
                to java, new to webapps, new to servlets, etc. Care should be taken in the 
                writing of the basic documents to not assume too much knowledge. In fact 
                the basic directory should strictly be concerned with the distribution and 
                should not stray out too far into other topics. 
                
                Advanced: the advanced directory 
                should contain targeted sections dealing to specific aspects of jetty, for 
                example embedding jetty, using jetty with maven, using jetty in unit tests, 
                information about the architecture of jetty, leveraging the jetty-client, 
                osgi frameworks, etc.

    <title>A Beginners Guide</title>
<!-- 
                First we want a general introduction to what jetty is, perhaps a bit 
                        of history but fairly short and sweet explanation of the what and why for 
                        jetty. -->
    <xi:include href="basic/introduction/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Getting started gives the reader enough to download and run the most 
                        simple example of jetty, the distribution which is a very common use case 
                        for someone new to jetty. If know they don't need the distribution then they 
                        are knowledgable enough to consult the TOC for what they want so we keep 
                        this simple and clear for people that don't know what they are doing yet. -->
    <xi:include href="basic/getting-started/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Next we have a section completely devoted to configuring the distribution, 
                        targeted areas that are focused on the specific tangible scenarios that people 
                        working with the distribution will run across, if discussion goes to advanced 
                        topics just describe and link deeper into document. NOTE: some topics might 
                        be worth of breaking into a separate basic chapter, like sessions? -->
    <xi:include href="basic/configuring/chapter.xml" />
<!-- 
                Once someone has configured their container they will want to deploy 
                        their application so this chapter discusses how to deploy war files onto 
                        the container or how to link static resources, the context handling system, 
                        etc. 
                        -->
    <xi:include href="basic/deploying/chapter.xml" />
<!-- 
          Sessions are a huge part of many peoples applications and we should take care
          to detail out the options available with jetty session management.
           -->

<!-- 
            JNDI has been a source of a lot of questions so it makes sense to call it out
            as a specific section and give it justice
           -->
    <xi:include href="basic/jndi/chapter.xml" />
<!-- 
            JMX has been a source of a lot of questions as well so it makes sense to call it out
            as a specific section and give it justice

<!-- What are good things to consider when running jetty, managing garbage 
                        collection, etc etc. -->
    <xi:include href="basic/tuning/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Now that folks have their webapp deployed into jetty and everything 
                        is supposed to be working, how do they debug issues and resolve them? -->
    <xi:include href="basic/troubleshooting/chapter.xml" />
<!-- StackOverflow has a lot of information about common questions, we 
                        should mine it periodically to add to this section. NOTE: merge with troubleshooting? -->

                        help -->

<!-- ADVANCED -->
  <part xml:id="part-two">
    <title>Advanced Topics</title>
<!-- We should perhaps start off here with details about the architecture 
                        of jetty, how it all comes together for the lifecycle of a request, how our 
                        pooling works, etc -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/architecture/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Information about the start.jar -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/starting/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Logging is a critical component of jetty and should have its own section 
                        on how to change logging frameworks, how to redirect logging, override webapp 
                        logging, etc -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/logging/chapter.xml" />
<!-- The jetty client is a complex topic and suitable for an advanced section 
                        in of itself. -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/client/chapter.xml" />
<!-- How to use the jetty-maven-plugin is a big topic and is definitely 
                        in the advanced section of things. -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/maven/chapter.xml" />
<!-- 
     How to write and wire up custom handlers

<!-- 
                 Deployment Overlays
                 -->
<!-- Security topics could go here, if we want to go indepth on them, it 
                        would probably be a good idea. NOTE: or perhaps we should have one combo 
                        section on sessions and security. -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/security/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Using jetty in third party frame works like spring or osgi -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/frameworks/chapter.xml" />
<!-- osgi ought to go under frameworks -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/osgi/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Notes about upgrading from previous versions of jetty. -->
    <xi:include href="advanced/upgrading/chapter.xml" />
<!-- Contribution is a big topic and it might be good to have how to build 
                        jetty, how to submit patches, etc here opposed to in the basic section. -->
