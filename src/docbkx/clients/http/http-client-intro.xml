  <para>The Jetty HTTP client module provides easy-to-use APIs, utility classes and a high performance, asynchronous
  implementation to perform HTTP and HTTPS requests.</para>
  <para>The Jetty HTTP client module requires Java version 1.7 or superior and it is Java 1.8 lambda compliant, that
  is, Java 1.8 applications can use lambda expressions in many of the HTTP client APIs.</para>
  <para>Jetty HTTP client is implemented and offers an asynchronous API, that is a programming interface that never
  blocks for I/O events, thus making it very efficient in thread utilization and well suited for load testing and
  parallel computation.</para>
  <para>However, sometimes all you need to do is to perform a GET request to a resource, and Jetty HTTP client offers
  also a synchronous API, that is a programming interface where the thread that issued the request blocks until the
  request/response conversation is complete.</para>
  <para>Out of the box features that you get with the Jetty HTTP client are:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Redirect support; redirect codes such as 302 or 303 are automatically followed</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Cookies support; cookies sent by servers are stored and sent back to servers in matching requests</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Authentication support; HTTP "Basic" and "Digest" authentications are supported, others are
      pluggable</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Forward proxy support</para>
    </listitem>

    <para>The main class is named, as in Jetty 7 and Jetty 8,
    <classname>org.eclipse.jetty.client.HttpClient</classname> (although it is not backward compatible with the same
    class in Jetty 7 and Jetty 8).</para>
    <para>You can think of an <code>HttpClient</code> instance as a browser instance. Like a browser, it can make
    requests to different domains, it manages redirects, cookies and authentication, you can configure it with a proxy,
    and it provides you with the responses to the requests you make.</para>
    <para>In order to use <code>HttpClient</code>, you must instantiate it, configure it, and then start it:</para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting language="java">
<![CDATA[
// Instantiate HttpClient
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();

// Configure HttpClient, for example:
httpClient.setFollowRedirects(false);

// Start HttpClient
httpClient.start();
]]>
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    <para>You can create multiple instances of <code>HttpClient</code>; the reason to do this is that you want to
    specify different configuration parameters (for example, one instance is configured with a forward proxy while
    another is not), or because you want the two instances to behave like two different browsers and hence have
    different cookies, different authentication credentials and so on.</para>
    <para>When you create a <code>HttpClient</code> instance using the parameterless constructor, you will only be able
    to perform plain HTTP requests, and you will not be able to perform HTTPS requests.</para>
    <para>In order to perform HTTPS requests, you should create first a <code>SslContextFactory</code> (see <xref
    linkend="ssl" />
<!--TODO: cross link SslContextFactory docs-->
    ), configure it, and pass it to <code>HttpClient</code>'s constructor. When created with a <code>
    SslContextFactory</code>, the <code>HttpClient</code> will be able to perform both HTTP and HTTPS requests to any
    domain.</para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting language="java">
<![CDATA[
// Instantiate and configure the SslContextFactory
SslContextFactory sslContextFactory = new SslContextFactory();

// Instantiate HttpClient with the SslContextFactory
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(sslContextFactory);

// Configure HttpClient, for example:
httpClient.setFollowRedirects(false);

// Start HttpClient
httpClient.start();
]]>
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
